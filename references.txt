============================

For further understanding of Game Engines, I looked up the Quintus HTML5 engine (http://www.html5quintus.com/documentation#.VQjpRhDF883) and looked at how they implement games.

I also looked through the Reddit Gamedev discussions (https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev) as well as the HTML5 Gave Devs forums (http://www.html5gamedevs.com/).

I struggled a bit with the collision detection, searching with google lead to this site (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/gg589497%28v=vs.85%29.aspx), which used an idea of an 'offset' to broaden (a bit) the window of the collision.
